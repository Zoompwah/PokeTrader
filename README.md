## Background

### Problem:
- Deck Management: Managing a collection and optimizing decks for competitive play or personal enjoyment can be overwhelming.

- Trading: TCG Players desire to trade with other traders without a knowledge of the cards that other traders own.

- Negotiation: Traders often have a hard time negotiating the prices for cards.

### Solution:

- Our project aims to address these problems by developing a Pokémon trading card app. This app will provide a platform where users can list out their cards for sale, browse listings from other users, build and manage their card decks, and trade their cards with other users cards or purchase them securely. By creating this app, we aim to provide Pokémon enthusiasts with a convenient, efficient, and safe way to engage in card trading and collecting activities.
